Hello everyone, my name is Alexander Ovdiienko and this is my Distributed Averaging System (DAS) project.
 DAS - this is a Java-based distributed application that implements a UDP communication system capable of calculating averages across multiple networked instances. 

Instruction about how to start an app you can find in Main.java :)
